In this repository, we present the code used to conduct experiments related to comparing models 
for automatically distinguishing relevant from irrelevant reviews of Madrid metro stations.

In the file ComparingModels.ipynb, you can find the complete code. 
To obtain only those comments belonging to the Airport or Hospital stations, you need to add the following code:

df = df[df['Estación'].str.contains('Hospital')]
or
df = df[df['Estación'].str.contains('Aeropuerto')]
after
df = pd.read_excel('TODAS_ESTACIONES.xlsx')

In the files AllComments_1.xlsx and AllComments_2.xlsx, two randomly selected subsets of 1,000 comments each can be obtained.

You can use these files as substitutes for the TODAS_ESTACIONES.xlsx.

The results obtained in all the experiments performed for this work can be seen in
